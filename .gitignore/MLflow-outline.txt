1. Understand the Problem and the Data: Start by understanding the problem you're trying to solve and the data you have. This might involve reading documentation, talking to experts, or doing exploratory data analysis.

2. Prepare the Data: Use the make_dataset.py script in the src/data directory to prepare your data. This might involve cleaning the data, dealing with missing values, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

3. Build Features: Use the build_features.py script in the src/features directory to build features from your data. This might involve selecting relevant features, creating new features, and transforming features.

4. Train the Model: Use the train_model.py script in the src/models directory to train your model. This might involve choosing a model, setting its parameters, and fitting it to your training data.

5. Evaluate the Model: Use the predict_model.py script in the src/models directory to make predictions with your model, and then evaluate its performance. This might involve calculating metrics like accuracy or mean squared error, and comparing your model to a baseline or to previous models.

6. Visualize the Results: Use the visualize.py script in the src/visualization directory to create visualizations of your results. This might involve plotting your model's predictions, creating confusion matrices, or visualizing feature importances.

7. Document Your Work: Document your work in the docs directory and in the README.md file. This might involve writing about your problem, your data, your methods, and your results, as well as providing instructions for how to run your code.

8. Test Your Code: Write tests for your code in the tests directory and run them to make sure your code works as expected. This might involve writing unit tests for your functions and integration tests for your scripts.

9. Track Your Experiments: Use MLflow to track your experiments. This might involve logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts for each run, and comparing runs in the MLflow UI.

10. Iterate on Your Model: Based on your results and your tests, iterate on your model. This might involve going back to step 2 to prepare your data differently, going back to step 3 to build different features, or going back to step 4 to train a different model.

11. Deploy Your Model: Once you're satisfied with your model, use the models directory to save your model and prepare it for deployment. This might involve saving your model to a file, creating a script to load the model and make predictions, and setting up a server or API to serve your model.

Remember, this is just a typical workflow and your actual workflow might look different depending on your problem, your data, and your requirements.
